## Usage

### The first steps is sign up and log in

When visiting the page for the first time you will be in the home page, you will be able to see existing post but you will not be able to interact with them. To do so you must sign up and log in. To do this click the log in tab in the nav bar and create an account and log in.

### How to interact with posts?

Once you are logged in you may interact with post by clicking the comment button to view peoples comments and leave comments of your own. You may also interact with your own posts by clicking the dashboard tab and there you will be able to create new post, see your existing post, edit posts, and delete posts.
